### 🧭 Our goals

The two main, things that we put forward at Arak-arahm is the creativity 🖌️ and the quality 💎. Why those ?

- Quality because we want to provide 🎁 to players the best playing experience: no lag, no bugs and stuff.

It's a challenge that we take every day, but it's not always easy to achieve it 😄


### 💻 Technologies

At Arak-arahm we always want to improve ourselves by discovering new technologies or simply by practising and learning new things every day.<br>
So what technologies do we use ?

- Java: it's the main language used at Arak-arahm. It is used to create plugins, applications and understand the basics of Minecraft.
- Docker/K8s: K8s and Docker are in our opinions two of the best technologies that exist in the world. Our entire infrastructure is made with these!

We used many others, but it would take too long to list them all.
